<p><strong>Adme Drug Design</strong>, ADME is to eliminate weak drug candidates in the early stages of drug development which allow resources to be focused on potential drug candidates 1. The last decade has seen tremendous progress in the development of analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry and molecular biology tools resulting in important advances in drug discovery particularly in the area of absorption distribution metabolism and excretion ADME.

In recent decades in silico absorption distribution metabolism excretion ADME and toxicity T modelling as a tool for rational drug design has received considerable attention from pharmaceutical scientists and various ADMET-related prediction models have been reported. Because it is impractical to perform intricate and costly ADMET experimental procedures for vast numbers of compounds in silico ADMET prediction is becoming the method of choice in early drug discovery.</p>
