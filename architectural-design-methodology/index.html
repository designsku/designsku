<p>ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN Methodology Process The difference in the method methodology and process is ignored for UG students in the present context The process of design even in the modern architectural schools is based on a trial and error method or proposing testing improving. Conventional procedures of design such as drawing can be regarded as design methods but since the 1950s new procedures have been developed that are more usually grouped together. To overcome this problem this paper seeks to contribute a clarification of the main problems concerning the maintenance of buildings and their implications in drafting the project. And makes clear why the steps of the method exist.</p>
