<p><strong>Advantages Of Truss Bridge Design</strong>, Two of the most used truss bridges are of the Pratt and Howe design. This bridge type uses ridged triangles in the design which makes it very strong. The design addresses all members behavior diagonal members are in tension vertical members in compression.</p>

<p>Minimal amounts of materials needed to build a truss bridge and each piece is used very efficiently. When heavy objects travel over a bridge the weight attempts to modify the structure through the creation of a bending. Economical To Build The materials to build a truss bridge are minimal and every single bit is used very efficiently. This is why bridge design is of the utmost importance.</p>
<h3 id="truss-bridges-are-extremely-effective-because-they-have-a-high-strength-to-weight-ratio">Truss bridges are extremely effective because they have a high strength to weight ratio.</h3><p>Truss bridges are extremely effective because they have a high strength to weight ratio. A howe truss is bridge truss that has axial compressive forces in the diagonal members and axial tensile forces in the vertical members. Further advantages of a truss bridge are listed below. This bridge type uses ridged triangles in the design which makes it very strong. The curved design of the arch bridge gives the structure an added element of strength that is not always found in alternative designs. This is perhaps why theyre such a popular option for bridge builders.</p>

<p>Versatile and adaptable design. It can be constructed piece by piece which makes cost lesser than conventional ones which require the entire framework to be set up before building. Pratt Truss Bridge design is a cost-effective structure that is easier to build by unskilled labor it has a low initial cost and is easy to transport. Another advantage of using trusses as the foundation of bridge design is that engineers can place the deck on top of the structure instead of incorporating the roadway within it.
