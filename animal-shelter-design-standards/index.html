<p>A sheltering facility should be built in a central location accessible to the human population being served and should be sited and designed in a way that is welcoming to the public. Shelters Planners of America is a pioneer in these designs. It should provide a safe and healthy environment for both animals and the people who care for them. The booklet stresses the fact that building a shelter may not be the best solution in every situation and suggests some alternative projects to consider see Section 1.
