The International Building Code IRC and the 2017 Residential Edition of the Florida Building Code FBC R8071 both state that the attic access must be readily accessible and also provide specs for the size of a ceiling or wall access opening. You can put there a couch or a small sofa a comfortable armchair with a footstool and a coffee able or a pair of side tables. The attic of this modern house in Los Angeles built in 1949 hard to believe offers stunning views of the lavish vegetation around basically connecting the interior with the wild exterior.
