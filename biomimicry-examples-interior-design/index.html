The lack of a clearly defined approach to biomimicry that interior designers can initially employ particularly if the goal is to increase the sustainability of the built environmentInterior design uses biology as a library of shapes alone as biomimetics without some biology in it. The skin of a shark is an evolutionary trait that increases its speed and prevents microorganisms from latching onto the skin. The result is a structure that is strong as well as lightweight- and pretty cool-looking to boot. As it can lead to innovative solutions and ideas as well as sustainable and functional perspectives.

<p>This article explores the ways in which biomimicry techniques based on the Design Spiral and Janine Benyus Biomimicry Design Lens Principles of Life can be combined with the design process of an interior design thereby to create a framework with the help of which a designer works and creates a sustainable interior design. This bionic dome built by University of Stuttgarts Institute for Computational Design ICD and the Institute of Building Structures and Structural Design ITKE is modeled on the plate skeleton of a sea urchin.
