<p>When an inductor is placed in series with the power source and a resistor is placed in parallel to that same power source as shown in the diagram circuit above this type of circuit forms a low pass filter. You may want to experiment with the design to get the exact result you want with respect to your signal. See the relevant documentation for details. This will give the filter a steep skirt at the first possible harmonic frequency of 176 MHz 881 x 2 1762. Active Filters Circuit Diagram Valve Amplifier Electronics Projects For Beginners.</p>
