Copyright 2020 Joanna Clarke. This is as opposed to active design which makes use of active building services systems to create comfortable conditions such as boilers and chillers mechanical ventilation electric lighting and so on. Active design is a set of building and planning principles that promote physical activity. You would even consider solar energy capture as an active process. For example a building may have wide windows that automatically let in more light when the building needs heat and automatically shade when the building is too hot.</p>
