<p><strong>Bell Mouth Inlet Design</strong>, Bell-mouth spillways Some spillways are designed like an inverted bell so that water can enter all around the perimeter. A bellmouth inlet flowmeter is a device that provides flow conditioning and flow measurement whose inlet is located or positioned in a large reservoir or supply source. A bell mouth is a tapered channel used to properly direct the flow at the intake of any air breathing engine.</p>

The Right Bellmouth From performancebyie.com</p>
<p>In the CFD simulation phase the three bell mouth inlet ducts have been simulated to know which one is better in terms of air flow adaptation and the results of the air mass flow at different locations when changing outlet. 2831 End Fitting Design and Top Stiffener or Bellmouth The end fitting design is a critical component of the global flexible pipe design process. Examples for optimal arrangement of pump wells are shown in Figures 5 and 6. These all inlet pipes are connected to one vertical pipe inside the intake well.</p>
