This review discusses the rigorous experimental design and sample preparation in the context of applying metagenomics in environmental sciences and biotechnology. Results are easy to interpret and lead to statistically justified conclusions. A design that chooses experimental points uniformly scattered on the domain is known as uniform experimental design and uniform experimental design can be regarded as a fractional factorial design with model uncertainty a space-filling design for computer experiments a robust design against the model specification and a supersaturated design and can be applied to experiments with mixtures.</p>
