<h3 id="computer-aided-architectural-design-caad-tools-have-been-available-to-the-architect-in-practically-useful-form-for-a-close-to-a-century">Computer Aided Architectural Design CAAD tools have been available to the architect in practically useful form for a close to a century.</h3><p>CAD centralizes product design into an automated 3D environment. Computer aided design is an activity where design engineers draughtsmen and drawing assistants use specialized interactive computer systems as their assisting instruments in order to formulate and solve technical design problems and to communicate the resulting problem solutions. Benefits of using CAD design software include more precise drawing ease for the designer to share plans with clients and third parties such as general contractors and engineers and secure archiving of past projects. We think ACAD is the possible answer on this clue. Computer Aided Architectural Design CAAD tools have been available to the architect in practically useful form for a close to a century.
