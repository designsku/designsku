<p>Because there are 3 observations for every combination of Temperature and GlassType this design is balanced. One of the assumptions in performing a Nested Gage analysis is that the data is balanced meaning that it has an equal number of observations for all possible combinations of the factor levels. A - gender observational factor B - drug experimental factor Factor A has a 2 levels. When a design is balanced each column of the design array has the same number of each of the levels of that parameter.</p>
<h3 id="aliasing-can-occur-in">Aliasing can occur in.</h3><p>In other words we can say that Bose and Shrikhande 1959a 1959b 1960a introduced a general class of incomplete block design which they called pair-wise balanced. The way this will show up in your output is that you will see the between subject section showing withing subject variables. This is a balanced randomized complete block design RCBD Two factors. If youre not sure whether your design is balanced or not Minitab makes it easy to find out. One of the assumptions in performing a Nested Gage analysis is that the data is balanced meaning that it has an equal number of observations for all possible combinations of the factor levels. The balance means that all differences between treatments are measured with equal precision.</p>

If youre not sure whether your design is balanced or not Minitab makes it easy to find out.
