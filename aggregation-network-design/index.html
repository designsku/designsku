<p>The distribution layer interacts between the access layer and the core by aggregating access layer connections in wiring closets providing intelligent routing and switching and applying access policies to access the rest of the network. Using Link Aggregation it is simple to have these multiple Ethernet connections to act as one logical connection hardening the network in case a wire fails and increasing total bandwidth when. Fault isolation and high-speed backbone connectivity are the primary functions of the core layer. The aggregation layer connects to the uplinks of the edge switches and is uplinked to the distribution layer toward the network core.</p>

<p>Another advantage is the ease of adding additional hardware and capacity. The need to access information instantly is becoming mandatory. The distribution layer interacts between the access layer and the core by aggregating access layer connections in wiring closets providing intelligent routing and switching and applying access policies to access the rest of the network. The choice of an appropriate architectural approach and sizing model for the aggregation network is studied in this paper through cost optimization models which encompass as-pects of non-stop delivery service ﬂexibility policy management and cost allocation.

<p>Data center network is divided into 3 standard three-layer structure. While in a three-tier network one server may need to traverse a hierarchical path through two aggregation switches and one core switch to communicate with another switch which adds latency and creates traffic bottlenecks. Keeping the network diameter low ensures low and predictable latency between devices.
