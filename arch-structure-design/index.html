STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF INTRODUCTION The railway bridge at Maidenhead England constructed in 1838 is a brick arch with a span of 128 ft and a rise of 243 ft. This arch was designed by engineer Marc Brunel who is also credited with being the first to use reinforced brick masonry. In all arch bridges the structural difficulty can be found in the minimization of the misalignment of the arch axis and the line of thrust as well as a sufficient bending and buckling resistance. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe architect. 12 Crown Hall 1IT Chicago USA 1952-56.</p>

An arch is a structural member curved in a vertical plane and the loads on the arch are carried by the arch ribs mainly through direct axial thrusts the bending moments and shear forces being small compared to a girder which requires larger section to withstand larger bending moments and shear forces caused by the same loading.
