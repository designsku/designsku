<p>Please anybody help me who has experience of design of. Tank Inspection Repair Alteration and Reconstruction. Addendum 3 This package contains Addendum 3 of API Standard 620 Design and Construction of Large Welded Low-pressure Storage Tanks Eleventh EditionThis package consists of the pages that have changed. API 620 Design and Construction of Large Welded Low-Pressure Storage Tanks is a standard developed and published by the American Petroleum Institute that gives requirements for the design and construction of large welded storage tanks with pressures in their gas or vapor spaces of not more than 15 lbfin2 gauge.</p>
<h3 id="these-storage-tanks-operate-at-250f-or-less-with-an-operating-pressure-of-up-to-15-psi">These storage tanks operate at 250F or less with an operating pressure of up to 15 PSI.</h3><p>Apply the terminology of storage tanks. Understand the important requirements of API 650 API 653 and API 620 including their addenda and annexes. Atmospheric pressure no refrigerated tanks shall be designed to API 650. API 620 covers the design and construction of field assembled large storage tanks operating in the low-pressure zone. API 620 regulates the design and manufacture of large steel low-pressure storage tanks usually larger than 300 feet in diameter. In addition its design features a flat or slightly raised bottom and a single centred vertical axis with a minimum thickness of 316 inches.</p>
