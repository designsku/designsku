<p>Retrospective cohort study is a type of study whereby investigators design the study recruit subjects and collect background information of the subject after the outcome of interest has been developed while the prospective cohort study is an investigation carried out before the outcomes of interest have been developed. When investigators describe the study design they employed the term retrospective cohort commonly is selected and commonly used incorrectly. A prospective cohort study design is ranked higher in the hierarchy of evidence than a retrospective design because the outcome predictor and confounding variables can be better measured and controlled. 4 A recent example of a prospective cohort study by Davey Smith et al was published in the BMJ 5 and a retrospective cohort design was used to assess the use of AE.
