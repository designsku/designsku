<p><strong>Bicycle Rear Suspension Design</strong>, The objective of this study is to design and develop a proper geometry of rear suspension system for mountain bike and to study the motion mechanisms of rear suspension system. The design of front and rear suspension of a vehicle may be different. The most obvious difference with this design is that the bottom bracket and therefore the entire drivetrain is positioned on a link between the front and rear triangles.</p>
