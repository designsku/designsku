<p>ASIC design engineers are IT professionals specialized in application-specific integrated circuits used for specific purposes. Strictly speaking this also implies that an ASIC is built only for one and only one customer. Characterization involves testing the design with voltage and frequency shmooing to find the ideal operating conditions. Application Specific Integrated Circuits or ASICs are as the name indicates non-standard integrated circuits that have been designed for a specific use or application.</p>

An ASIC is basically an integrated circuit designed specifically for a special purpose or application. A formal classification of ASICs tends to become a bit fluffy around the edges. Characterization involves testing the design with voltage and frequency shmooing to find the ideal operating conditions. ASICs are usually preferred for high-level applications.
