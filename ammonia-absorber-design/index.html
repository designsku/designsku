<p>In all design example I found the stream is ammonia with air or other materials and the ammonia concentration is up to 20. Your job as a group is to set forth and carry out a series of pressure drop tracer response and ammonia absorption experiments that will provide data and results derived from the data that serve as a good basis for the design of a full-scale scrubber. In gas absorption a soluble vapors are more or less absorbed in the solvent from its mixture with inert gas. Im currently designing an ammonia absorption tower.</p>
