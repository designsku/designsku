<!-- Head tag Code -->
<p><strong>A Designed Experiment</strong>, A designed experiment is a test or series of tests in which purposeful changes are made to the input variables of a process or system so that we may observe and identify the reasons for changes in the output response. A designed experiment applies a treatment to individuals referred to as experimental units or subjects and attempts to isolate the effects of the treatment on a response variable. Thinking about what could impact the loss of moisture it is likely that the baking time and the oven temperature will affect the results.</p>
