Gerard Williams III who led the design of every Apple chip core from the A7 to the A12X. Apple has already used its Arm-based chip design to power its iPhones and iPads but the move to M1 processors for its Macs completely eliminates its dependency on Intel. I am a first year Graduate student and I have an interview next week with Apples Hardware Technology Group for a Summer Design Implementation Engineer intern position. Apple has decided to change that and redesigned this part of the credit card as well.
