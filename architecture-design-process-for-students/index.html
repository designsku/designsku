Other than being able to think critically and creatively architecture students also need to be able to think pragmatically in Design Studio. The design process can be daunting to new students who often find it difficult to find a direction in their design. Continuing the design process the architect prepares drawings suitable for permit submittal and construction which are referred to as construction drawings CDs. 1 Problem formation inception identification recognition definition 2 Data collection and Analysis.
