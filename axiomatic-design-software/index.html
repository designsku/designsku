<p>Axiomatic design theory has been applied to many different topics ranging from design of products software organizations scheduling manufacturing systems to materials and materials processing techniques. Our team encompasses electrical mechanical software validation and quality engineering expertise. It combines the power of axiomatic design with a popular software. The axioms are applied during the design process.</p>
<h3 id="it-combines-the-power-of-axiomatic-design-with-a-popular-software">It combines the power of axiomatic design with a popular software.</h3><p>Our team encompasses electrical mechanical software validation and quality engineering expertise. It combines the power of axiomatic design with a popular software. Design problems are formulated and design solutions developed from abstract to detailed down hierarchies of abstraction and across functional physical and process domains during a zigzagging decomposition process so that the design solution is consistent with the axioms. New control designs incorporate the latest in component technology and software programming. It is a practical example of Nam Suhs theory.
