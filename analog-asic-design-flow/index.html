<p>Our well established ASIC design flow allows for robust and reproducible first-time-right ASICS with a clear focus on formal checking improving and compliance to. Let us assume we all are IC design engineers So you are getting the specification from the customer say to design a full adder. For example the customer says to design a Full adder with 2GHz or 5GHz frequency. Test development actually occurs throughout the Design Phase 12 and 3 as Hexius Semiconductor plans on what to test and how to test it when we design the schematics and access points but only after the ASICs characterization is the full test requirement understood.</p>
