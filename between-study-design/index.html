<p>A badly designed study can never be retrieved whereas a poorly analysed one can usually be reanalysed. Study design is a process wherein the trial methodology and statistical analysis are organized to ensure that the null hypothesis is either accepted or rejected and the conclusions arrived at reflect the truth. The most common design is called a parallel study.

<p>1 Consideration of design is also important because the design of a study will govern how the data are to be analys. For example it might involve comparing teaching methods or treatments for anxiety or other mental. Research design and methods are different but closely related because good research design ensures that the data you obtain will help you answer your research question more effectively. The study designs themselves were secondary to our interest.
